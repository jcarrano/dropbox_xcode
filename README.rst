=====================================
(Unofficial) Dropbox Music Transcoder
=====================================

----------------------------------------------
Download and transcode FLAC files from Dropbox
----------------------------------------------

What is this
============

This is a script that recursively downloads whole directory trees from Dropbox
and converts FLAC files on-the-fly to OPUS.

This way, you can keep your precious FLAC files in the "cloud" and still have
your music fit in your HDD.

You will need to get an API key to use this.

Why?
====

Turns out that I had:

- Too many FLAC files in dropbox
- A too tiny SSD.
- Too much time to waste writing a script instead of doing the reasonable thing
  and downloading to an external drive.
